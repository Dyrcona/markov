README for markov
=================
Jason J.A. Stephenson <jason@sigio.com>

markov is a c++ library containing a class for a Markov chain text
generator.

It's public and protected members are fully documented in doc comments
in the chain.hh file.  You can generate documentation into a doc/
subfolder by running `doxygen doxygen.cfg` in the main project
directory.  (TODO: Add doc and doc-install targets in Makefile.am.)

It can be configured and installed using the GNU autotools and the
configure script.  If you don't find a configure script in the main
project directory, simply run `autoreconf --install` to create it and
the other necessary files.  This requirement probably means that you
acquired the source code via git.

In addition to the standard configure arguments, markov also supports
a `--with-random=FILE` argument.  This argument allows you to specify
a device file from which to get pseudo-random digits.  This parameter
is purely optional, and if not supplied, the configure script will
look for a suitable device and if not found, will fall back to using
the standard library's `time()` function.

markov is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
version 3.0 or, at your option, any later version.  This means that
you cannot distribute it in non-GPL licensed projects without express
written consent of the author(s).
