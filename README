README for markov
=================
Jason J.A. Stephenson <jason@sigio.com>

markov is a c++ library containing a class for a Markov chain text
generator.

Its public and protected members are fully documented in doc comments
in the chain.hh file.  If you have doxygen installed, then html
documentation will be generated and installed to
`$(docdir)/markov/html/`.

It can be configured and installed using the GNU autotools and the
configure script.  If you don't find a configure script in the main
project directory, simply run `autoreconf --install` to create it and
the other necessary files.  This requirement probably means that you
acquired the source code via git.

In addition to the standard configure arguments, markov also supports
a `--with-random=FILE` argument.  This argument allows you to specify
a device file from which to get pseudo-random digits.  This parameter
is purely optional, and if not supplied, the configure script will
look for a suitable device and if not found, will fall back to using
the standard library's `time()` function.

markov is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
version 3.0 or, at your option, any later version.  This means that
you cannot include it in non-GPL licensed projects without express
written consent of the author(s).
